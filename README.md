# EduJunior App

-As part of a college project, we created a multi-functional App to provide children with  unique academical learning 

-> *Complete project in the master branch*

-Features: 
          -safe parental Login-Signup (app will automatically logout incase child closes the app, ensures child cant access content without parental knowledge)
            This is connected to firebase and its authentication system
            We also have implemented the password hiding method

         
          -4 subjects(English, Maths, Art, Sci) each having the following features
                      -Videoplayer (Videos for the child to watch)
                      -Reading material (Reading material for the child to read about the subject)
                      -Quiz (a timed quiz for the child to take in relevance to the subject)
          
           -An art Drwaing page(here children can unleash their inner artist)

           -splash screen (the app has a start up animation page)

           
            Children are generally more energetic and always curious hence ^ these features are designed to entertain as well as provide knowledge at the same time.


*There is a video in the main branch of a demo showing the working of the app 
Thank you for your time :)
